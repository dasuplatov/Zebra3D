For each case-study of the Zebra3D+Mustguseal tool this package contains:
* the input data (i.e. 3D-alignments created by the Mustgusael) - in "strcore" subfolders;
* the "linux_run_all.sh" script to run all case-studies in linux

This data was downloaded from https://biokinet.belozersky.msu.ru/zebra3d-examples

Description and discussion of the ten case-studies illustrating diverse application of the Zebra3D+Mustguseal tool, 
including interpretation of the results, is provided in the Zebra3D publication. See this link for detals
